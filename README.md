 Documenting the journey to creating AI generated portraits of me! 

TODO
- why this project
I saw an article about how you can use AI to generate an image of yourself in various stlyes and I thought it would be a fun thing to try out. I also wanted to learn more about AI and how it works. I spent a few days getting it working and scoured the internet to troubleshoot all the errors I ran into. I thought it would be cool to document my journey and share what I learned, and if it helps others that would be great!


- what is it
Automatic1111 is a tool that uses AI to generate an image of you in various styles. It uses a pre-trained model to generate the image. You can also train your own model if you want to, which is what I did in this demo by leveraging the Huggingface community and the Dreambooth extention.

Huggingface is a community of people who share their AI models. You can use their models to generate images, text, etc. For this demo the `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`, `v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt` model was used. 

Once all of this (plus some tweaks here & there) was set up, I was able to build my own AI model and generate an image of myself in various styles.
